        <p> Cristiano Ronaldo is the man known all around the world. From his
            <br> dashing looks to absolutely insane moments on the soccer pitch,
            <br> Ronaldo is an absolute icon of the game and is my favorite player in the world.
            <br> Ronaldo is also often referred to as the greatest player of all time. (GOAT)
